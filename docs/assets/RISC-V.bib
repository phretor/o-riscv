  month = oct,
  publisher = {Independently published},
  address = {Campinas, SP},
  abstract = {An Introduction to Assembly Programming with RISC-V is a textbook for programmers that want to learn how to program in assembly language. It leverages the RISC-V ISA to guide the reader through the main concepts of assembly programming and the assembly process.The book is divided into three parts: I) Fundamental concepts, II) User-level programming, and III) System-level programming.The first part, "fundamental concepts", starts by providing a brief overview of how computers are organized and how programs are executed by computers. Then, it discusses how data is represented on modern computers, including how numbers and text are represented, how data is organized on the main memory, and how computer instructions are encoded. Next, it discusses how native programs are generated, the assembly process, and the main elements of object (binary) files, including symbols, labels, and references. Finally, it introduces the main elements of the assembly language and some of the most common assembly directives. It is worth noting that most of the concepts introduced in this part are orthogonal to the RISC-V ISA, i.e., they do not change when programming in assembly language for other ISAs.The second part, "user-level programming", focuses on the implementation of user software, i.e., software that performs operations with data that is located on CPU registers and the main memory. It starts by presenting the basic elements of the RISC-V ISA, including the data types, registers, and instructions. Then, it shows how to use RISC-V instructions to implement basic control-flow sentences, such as conditionals and loops. Finally, it introduces the program stack, shows how to implement routines, and discusses the elements of the ABI and how it facilitates software composition. All examples in this part of the book rely on system calls to perform I/O operations.The third part focus on system-level programming, including interacting with peripherals and securing the system against faulty or malicious user programs. It starts by presenting how to write code to directly interact with input and output hardware devices and the concept of busy waiting. Then, it motivates the need for hardware interrupts and shows how to program them on RISC-V ISAs. Finally, it discusses privilege levels and how software interrupts and exceptions may be used to protect RISC-V systems from faulty or malicious user programs.},

By the end of this book, readers will be able to build their own RISC-V microprocessor and will have a top-to-bottom understanding of how it works.Beginning with digital logic gates and progressing to the design of combinational and sequential circuits, this book uses these fundamental building blocks as the basis for designing a RISC-V processor. SystemVerilog and VHDL are integrated throughout the text in examples illustrating the methods and techniques for CAD-based circuit design. The companion website includes a chapter on I/O systems with practical examples that show how to use SparkFun's RED-V RedBoard to communicate with peripheral devices such as LCDs, Bluetooth radios, and motors.This book will be a valuable resource for students taking a course that combines digital logic and computer architecture or students taking a two-quarter sequence in digital logic and computer organization/architecture. Covers the fundamentals of digital logic design and reinforces logic concepts through the design of a RISC-V microprocessorGives students a full understanding of the RISC-V instruction set architecture, enabling them to build a RISC-V processor and program the RISC-V processor in hardware simulation, software simulation, and in hardwareIncludes both SystemVerilog and VHDL designs of fundamental building blocks as well as of single-cycle, multicycle, and pipelined versions of the RISC-V architectureFeatures a companion website with a bonus chapter on I/O systems with practical examples that show how to use SparkFun's RED-V RedBoard to communicate with peripheral devices such as LCDs, Bluetooth radios, and motorsThe companion website also includes appendices covering practical digital design issues and C programming as well as links to CAD tools, lecture slides, laboratory projects, and solutions to exercisesSee the companion EdX MOOCs ENGR85A and ENGR85B with video lectures and interactive problems},

For decades, these processors were mainly based on the Arm instruction set architecture (ISA). In recent years, the free and open RISC-V ISA standard has attracted the attention of industry and academia and is becoming the mainstream. Data security and user privacy protection are common challenges faced by all IoT devices. In order to deal with foreseeable security threats, the RISC-V community is studying security solutions aimed at achieving a root of trust (RoT) and ensuring that sensitive information on RISC-V devices is not tampered with or leaked. Many RISC-V security research projects are underway, but the academic community has not yet conducted a comprehensive survey of RISC-V security solutions. In order to fill this research gap, this paper presents an in-depth survey on RISC-V security technologies. This paper summarizes the representative security mechanisms of RISC-V hardware and architecture. Based on our survey, we predict the future research and development directions of RISC-V security. We hope that our research can inspire RISC-V researchers and developers.},

Unlike most other ISA designs, RISC-V is provided under royalty-free open-source licenses. Many companies are offering or have announced RISC-V hardware; open source operating systems with RISC-V support are available, and the instruction set is supported in several popular software toolchains. The project began in 2010 at the University of California, Berkeley. There are now members in over 70 countries contributing and collaborating to define RISC-V open specifications. RISC-V International, the non-profit managing RISC-V, is currently headquartered in Switzerland.},

  author = {Solt, Flavien and {Ceesay-Seitz}, Katharina and Razavi, Kaveh},
  abstract = {Generating interesting test cases for CPU fuzzing is akin to generating programs that exercise unusual states inside the CPU. The performance of CPU fuzzing is heavily influenced by the quality of these programs and by the overhead of bug detection. Our analysis of existing state-of-the-art CPU fuzzers shows that they generate programs that are either overly simple or execute a small fraction of their instructions due to invalid control flows. Combined with expensive instruction-granular bug detection mechanisms, this leads to inefficient fuzzing campaigns. We present Cascade, a new approach for generating valid RISC-V programs of arbitrary length with highly randomized and interdependent control and data flows. Cascade relies on a new technique called asymmetric ISA pre-simulation for entangling control flows with data flows when generating programs. This entanglement results in non-termination when a program triggers a bug in the target CPU, enabling Cascade to detect a CPU bug at program granularity without introducing any runtime overhead. Our evaluation shows that long Cascade programs are more effective in exercising the CPU's internal design. Cascade achieves 28.2x to 97x more coverage than the state-of-the-art CPU fuzzers and uncovers 37 new bugs (28 new CVEs) in 5 RISC-V CPUs with varying degrees of complexity. The programs that trigger these bugs are long and intricate, impeding triaging. To address this challenge, Cascade features an automated pruning method that reduces a program to a minimal number of instructions that trigger the bug.},

Therefore, more and more security-critical workloads will be conducted with code that is compiled for RISC--V. Well-known microarchitectural side-channel attacks against established platforms like x86 apply to RISC--V CPUs as well. As RISC--V does not mandate any hardware-based side-channel countermeasures, a piece of code compiled for a generic RISC--V CPU in a cloud server cannot make safe assumptions about the microarchitecture on which it is running. Existing tools for aiding software-level precautions by checking side-channel vulnerabilities on source code or x86 binaries are not compatible with RISC--V machine code.},
